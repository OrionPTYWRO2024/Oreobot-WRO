# Oreobot-WRO
Panama´s Team Orion code for the 2024 WRO competition, in the Future Engineers category.

Welcome to Panama´s Team Orion GitHub page. Here we present our 2 sons, Oreobot 1.75, and Oreobot 2.0.
 
Oreobot 1.75 is a robot that uses an Osoyoo Arduino with an Osoyoo Motor Shield 1.1. It has three ultrasonic sensors and one TCS34725 colour sensor. It also has a yellow plastic gear motor for power and an Oosoyo servo for steering. It uses a rechargeable 9V battery.


As this paragraph is being currently getting written, during August 2nd, 2024, we used only Oreobot 1.75 for the regional competition, our plan was to
switch robots because of the Lego colour sensor, but we had to take a decision and the version 1.75 was the only one that gave some visual results, so we used it. To be honest, it turned out it did way better than in the previous practices and made  1 and 3/4, of the entire track, which gave us 15 points, a lot more than what we expected. However, the colour part is still difficult to manage but we are working with our only colour sensor. We hope we classify to the National competition to get more chances to upgrade our robot and do better in the competition. Thanks for reading until this part :D

After one month, we are here with some few modifications. It is not that much different from how Oreobot 1.75 was on our last regional, but we sure have a new welded (by us) rgb sensor which we hope works better than the TCS3200 colour sensor we had before. On the other hand, we are still waiting for some stuff we bought from Amazon to arrive, in case they do it during the practice day, we may probably replace the current battery and colour sensor for the ones.

Now, we are exited to face the challenges in the National competition and hope to enjoy it as much as possible. Thanks for reading!
