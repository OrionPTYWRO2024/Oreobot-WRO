# Oreobot-WRO
PanamaÂ´s Team Orion code for the 2024 WRO competition

Welcome to the Orion GitHub page, here we present our 2 sons, Oreobot 1.75, and Oreobot 2.0.

You may wonder why are there 2 robots, but there is a reason...     
Oreobot 1.75 is a robot that uses an Osoyoo Arduino with an Osoyoo Motor Shield 1.1. It has 3 ultrasonic sensors and one TCS3200 colour sensor. It also has a yellow plastic gear motor for power and uses a rechargeable 9V battery.

Our second robot is Oreobot 2.0, which uses EV3 as de coding source but has Lego pieces from various types of Lego sets, mainly mindstorm ones. We use 6 AA batteries to power it.

We have 2 different codes for each one, which are portrayed throughout our commits as well as the design and the youtube videos. We hope you enjoy our commits and they serve to explain how do our robots work.
