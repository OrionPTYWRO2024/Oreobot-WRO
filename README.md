# Oreobot-WRO
Panama´s Team Orion code for the 2024 WRO competition, in the Future Engineers category.

Welcome to Panama´s Team Orion GitHub page. Here we present our 2 sons, Oreobot 1.75, and Oreobot 2.0.
 
Oreobot 1.75 is a robot that uses an Osoyoo Arduino with an Osoyoo Motor Shield 1.1. It has three ultrasonic sensors and one TCS3200 colour sensor. It also has a yellow plastic gear motor for power and an Oosoyo servo for steering. It uses a rechargeable 9V battery.

Our second robot is Oreobot 2.0, which uses EV3 as the coding source but has Lego pieces from various types of Lego sets. It has three ultrasonic sensors, one traction and one steering servo, and a color sensor. all from MINDSTORMS. We use 6 AA batteries to power it.

You may wonder why are there 2 robots, but there is a reason...    

During our testing, we have noticed different pros and cons for each system. Arduino is faster and is more versatile in terms of components, while LEGO MINDSTORMS is more precise and easier to program. We have designed two robots in order to come to a conclusion on which is more effective with our relartvely limited resources. 

There are two different codes for each one, which are portrayed throughout our commits as well as the design and the youtube videos. 
We plan on sticking to one of them once we have conclusive results, but documentation has to made for both in case it is the final robot. We hope you enjoy our commits and they serve to explain how do our robots work. 

As this paragraph is being currently getting written, during August 2nd, 2024, we used only Oreobot 1.75 for the regional competition, our plan was to
switch robots because of the Lego colour sensor, but we had to take a decision and the version 1.75 was the only one that gave some visual results, so we used it. To be honest, it turned out it did way better than in the previous practices and made  1 and 3/4, of the entire track, which gave us 15 points, a lot more than what we expected. However, the colour part is still difficult to manage but we are working with our only colour sensor. We hope we classify to the National competition to get more chances to upgrade our robot and do better in the competition. Thanks for reading until this part :D
